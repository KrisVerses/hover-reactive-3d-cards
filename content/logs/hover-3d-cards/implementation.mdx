# Implementation Details

## Core Components

### Card Component

The card component uses a combination of CSS transforms and Framer Motion for smooth 3D effects:

```tsx
const Card = ({ title, description, imageUrl }: CardProps) => {
  const [mousePosition, setMousePosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });

  return (
    <motion.div
      className="relative w-full h-[400px] rounded-xl overflow-hidden"
      onMouseMove={handleMouseMove}
      style={{
        perspective: "1000px",
        transformStyle: "preserve-3d",
      }}
      whileHover={{
        scale: 1.05,
        transition: {
          type: "spring",
          stiffness: 300,
          damping: 20,
        },
      }}
    >
      {/* Card content */}
    </motion.div>
  );
};
```

### Animation System

1. **Hover Detection**
   - Tracks mouse position relative to card
   - Calculates rotation angles based on mouse position
   - Smooth transitions using spring physics

2. **3D Transformations**
   - Uses CSS perspective for 3D space
   - Applies rotateX and rotateY based on mouse position
   - Maintains smooth performance with transform properties

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Used `will-change` for better performance
   - Implemented proper React hooks usage
   - Optimized re-render cycles

## Responsive Design

1. **Grid Layout**
   - Responsive grid using TailwindCSS
   - Dynamic card sizing based on viewport
   - Smooth reflow animations

2. **Mobile Considerations**
   - Disabled 3D effects on touch devices
   - Simplified hover states for mobile
   - Maintained readability across devices

## Technical Challenges

1. **3D Effect Balance**
   - Finding the right perspective value
   - Balancing rotation intensity
   - Handling edge cases

2. **Performance**
   - Managing animation frame rate
   - Optimizing transform calculations
   - Reducing layout thrashing

## Solutions

1. **Smooth Animations**
   - Used spring physics for natural motion
   - Implemented proper easing functions
   - Added transition delays for better UX

2. **Performance**
   - Used CSS transforms instead of layout properties
   - Implemented proper React hooks
   - Added performance monitoring
