## TypeScript Configuration Insights

1. **Path Aliases and Module Resolution**
   - Understanding `tsconfig.json` path mappings
   - Setting up `@/` prefix for src directory
   - Configuring Contentlayer's generated types

2. **Contentlayer Integration**

   - Autocomplete for content properties
   - Generated type definitions

3. **Type Safety Benefits**
   - Runtime type checking
   - IDE autocompletion
   - Error prevention
   - Better developer experience

4. **Practical Examples**
   ```typescript
   // TypeScript knows all available properties
   const log = allLogs[0];
   log.title       // ✅ Autocomplete for string
   log.date        // ✅ Autocomplete for date
   log.description // ✅ Autocomplete for string
   log.slug        // ✅ Autocomplete for computed field
   ```

5. **Behind the Scenes**
   - Contentlayer's build process
   - Generated type definitions
   - TypeScript declaration files
   - Path resolution in tsconfig.json

6. **Contentlayer Configuration**
   - `defineDocumentType()` method
     - Defines content structure and type
     - Specifies required frontmatter fields
     - Sets up file path patterns for content discovery
     - Configures URL/slug generation for NextJS routing
   - `makeSource()` method
     - Configures content source behavior
     - Specifies root directory for content
     - Defines document processing rules
     - Sets up content transformations and validations
   - Plugin System
     - Extends Contentlayer's core functionality
     - Provides additional processing capabilities
     - Enables custom content transformations
     - Supports advanced content management features
   - Next.js Integration
     - `next.config.ts` wraps Next.js with Contentlayer
     - Enables MDX content processing in Next.js
     - Ensures type generation and content sync
     - Makes content available throughout the application
   - MDX Content Components
     - `MDXContent` component converts MDX to React
     - Uses `useMDXComponent` hook for processing
     - `components` prop maps HTML elements to custom components
     - Enables consistent styling across MDX content
     - Example: `<h1>` in MDX renders as custom styled component
     - Acts as a bridge between MDX content and React app
     - Transforms raw MDX into styled React components
     - Handles the conversion from markdown to interactive UI

## 3D Card Component Implementation

### CSS Perspective and Transform Styles
When implementing 3D effects in React components, particularly with Framer Motion, there are important considerations for CSS properties:

1. **Perspective Property**
   - The `perspective` property must be applied to a parent container
   - Using Tailwind's `perspective-{value}` utilities may not work as expected
   - Instead, use inline styles: `style={{ perspective: "1000px" }}`
   - The value (e.g., 1000px) determines the intensity of the 3D effect
     - Smaller values create more dramatic effects
     - Larger values create subtler effects

2. **Transform Style**
   - The `transform-style: preserve-3d` property is crucial for maintaining 3D space
   - Like perspective, it's more reliable when applied via inline styles
   - Must be applied to the element that receives the 3D transforms
   - Works in conjunction with perspective to create the full 3D effect

3. **Component Structure**
   - Use a three-layer structure for optimal 3D effects:
     1. Outer container: Provides perspective
     2. Middle container: Handles 3D transforms
     3. Inner container: Contains the actual content

4. **Framer Motion Integration**
   - Use `motion.div` for smooth 3D animations
   - Configure spring animations for natural movement:
     ```typescript
     transition={{
       type: "spring",
       stiffness: 300,  // Controls responsiveness
       damping: 20,     // Controls settling speed
     }}
     ```

### Best Practices
- Prefer inline styles over Tailwind utilities for 3D-specific properties
- Keep perspective and transform-style properties separate from other styling concerns
- Test different perspective values to find the right balance for your design
- Consider performance implications when using 3D transforms
- Use TypeScript interfaces to define clear prop types for reusable components
